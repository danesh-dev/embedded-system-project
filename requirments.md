Final List of Requirements for Car GPS Security System
1. Microcontroller:

    ATmega328P (or similar low-power microcontroller)

    Alternative: STM32F103C8T6 (if more processing power is needed)

2. GPS Module:

    NEO-6M GPS Module (low power, reliable, and cost-effective)

    Alternative: Ublox M8N (for better accuracy)

3. GSM Module:

    SIM800L (supports SMS and GPRS for data transmission)

    Alternative: SIM900A (if SIM800L is unavailable)

4. Accelerometer for Crash Detection:

    ADXL345 (low power, good accuracy, and budget-friendly)

    Alternative: MPU6050 (includes gyroscope but consumes more power)

5. Power System:

    Battery: 18650 Li-ion Rechargeable Battery (at least 2200mAh, preferably 4000mAh+)

    Battery Protection Circuit: TP4056 Module (for safe charging and over-discharge protection)

    Voltage Regulator: AMS1117 (for 3.3V and 5V power stabilization)

    Alternative Power Source: Car Cigarette Lighter Adapter (optional, if direct power from car is needed)

6. User Interaction:

    Emergency Button: Push button to send SOS SMS with GPS location

    On/Off Switch: Toggle switch to turn the device on/off

    LED Indicators: Power, GSM Signal, and GPS Lock status

7. PCB and Circuit Assembly:

    Custom PCB (can be designed using KiCad or Eagle)

    Prototype on Breadboard before finalizing PCB

    Soldering Iron, Solder Wire, Flux, and Multimeter for assembly and testing

8. Additional Components:

    Resistors (1kΩ, 10kΩ, etc.)

    Capacitors (10µF, 100µF)

    Diodes (1N4007 for reverse polarity protection)

    Connecting Wires and PCB connectors

    Enclosure Case (for housing the circuit securely)

9. Software Development:

    Firmware: C/C++ (Arduino IDE or STM32CubeIDE)

    Backend (Web Server): Laravel + PHP

    Database: MySQL (for storing location data)

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for displaying real-time location on a map)

10. Testing and Calibration:

    Test GPS accuracy and GSM signal strength in different locations

    Configure accelerometer sensitivity to detect real crash events

    Optimize power consumption for longer battery life

Next Steps Before Buying Components:

    Finalize the circuit design on paper or using simulation software (Proteus, KiCad)

    Write and test the initial firmware on a breadboard

    Optimize power requirements and sleep mode settings

    Prepare budget and purchase components accordingly
